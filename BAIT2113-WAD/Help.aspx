                14 Day Buyer Protection
                <br>
                Gallerion acts between buyer and seller. We ensure a smooth exchange between the item and the money paid.
                After the purchase Gallerion keeps the amount 14 days in its own account. In case of serious default by the artist supplying the goods, Gallerion will of course reimburse the purchase sum to the buyer.

                Gallerion acting as an intermediary between buyer and seller
                <br>
                We know our artists, and what the buyer expects. This enables us to act as an intermediary. We will do everything to achieve satisfactory results for both parties.

            <p class="faq-text">
                The artists are responsible for shipping the artwork. Immediately after your purchase the artist receives an e-mail with the request to ship the artwork and fill in a track & trace code.
                The artist has 72 hours to do this, and will notify you if more time is needed for shipment. After the artist has filled in a track & trace code you will receive an e-mail with more details about the shipment.
                You will be able to follow the package and see the expected time of delivery.
                <br>
                <br>
                It is the responsibility of the artist to send out the artwork in a correct and secure way. For international transport, the best method may be sending the art in a strong box or crate. This needs to be manufactured. It may be possible to discuss the best way of shipping with the buyer.

                We charge no commissions over sold work. The artist receives 100% of the sold work.
                Gallerion works on the principle beauty is in the eye of the beholder. If you regard yourself as an artist, you can present your work. Anyone is welcome to showcase his/her art on Gallerion.
                <br>
                <br>
                It may take a bit of time before all of your work is displayed on the website. However, your personal artist’s page will be live immediately, to share with your friends and on your own network.
                The website shows the artworks in a random order for each visitor. After 24 hours, this order will be adjusted again.
                If a sale has not taken place you can notify Gallerion by sending us an e-mail. We will verify and reimburse if the item has been billed incorrectly.
                Shipping/delivery charges (including packaging) can be invoiced to the purchaser. When posting your item online you can mention the charges for national and international shipping.

                It frequently happens an e-mail sent by a vendor to a buyer ends up in the spam/junk box. Please check. If you still have not received anything from the vendor 3 days (72 hours) after confirmation of your highest bid, you can write to Gallerion. We will send the vendor a reminder (with the buyer in cc) and start further proceedings if the vendor still does not react.

                <br>
                If you have received a damaged work (damaged during shipping or delivery, glass breakage or damage to the work itself) and this differs from the condition the vendor described, you can notify the vendor and Gallerion. It is important to report the damage immediately – do not wait. The vendor in principle is obliged to annul the sale and take back the work, unless vendor and buyer agree otherwise. The costs of the sale and shipping/delivery charges must be paid for by the vendor. The costs of shipping/return of the work to the vendor must be paid for by the buyer.

                        <li>The Platform offers the Art Lover the possibility to buy Products from Sellers. Sellers may use the order or auction system on the Platform or choose to include their contact details in or with the Offer so that the Art Lover can contact the Seller directly to enter into a purchase agreement. In the latter case Gallerion is in no way involved
                        in the conclusion and settlement of the aforementioned purchase agreements and accepts no liability whatsoever in this respect. In the case of an Agreement (thus as referred to in article 1.4 and which is concluded directly through the order or auction system on the Platform), Gallerion enters into the Agreement with the relevant Seller on behalf of the Art Lover. The Seller shall at all times independently take care of the delivery of the Products to the Art Lover. Within the framework of an Agreement, the Art Lover will fulfil its payment obligations under the Agreement to Gallerion.
                        </li>
                        <li>To be able to enter into agreements, the Art Lover, after he has registered on the Platform and after this registration has been approved by Gallerion, will receive login details to access his account on the Platform. When registering, the Art Lover must provide all the required mandatory information completely and truthfully.
                        </li>
                        <li>The Art Lover is not allowed to have more than one account on the Platform at the same time.
                        </li>
                        <li>The Art Lover must keep his login details strictly confidential in order to access his account. He may not make his account available to third parties. All actions carried out under the Art Lover's account shall be attributed to the registered Art Lover.
                        </li>
                        <li>The information contained in the Offer is determined by the respective Seller, for whose content Gallerion is not responsible. Gallerion is therefore not liable because the Service is based on incorrect or incomplete information provided by the Seller.
                        </li>
                        <li>The provisions of this article do not apply if the Seller does not act within the framework of the Agreement in the exercise of a profession or business. If, under the Agreement, the Seller is not acting in the course of a profession or business, this will be evident from the information in or accompanying the Offer.
                        </li>
                        <li>The Consumer who makes use of the right of dissolution, can dissolve the Agreement by submitting a request to Gallerion, respectively the Seller, by e-mail or by using the model revocation form. As soon as possible after the relevant party has been informed of the intention of the Consumer to dissolve the agreement and if the conditions of this article are met, that party will confirm the dissolution of the Agreement to the Consumer by e-mail.
                        </li>
                        <li>If the Consumer makes use of the right of dissolution, he must handle the Product in question and its packaging with care during the 14-day cooling-off period. The Consumer may only handle and inspect the Product to be returned to the Seller to the extent necessary to assess the nature and characteristics of the Product. The basic principle here is that the Consumer may only handle and inspect the Product as he would in a physical shop.
                        </li>
                        <li>Payment must be made by one of the payment methods chosen for this purpose by the Art Lover when entering into the Agreement. After the conclusion of the Agreement, the Art Lover shall be irrevocably bound to its payment obligation, without prejudice to the provisions in the other provisions of these general terms and conditions.
                        </li>
